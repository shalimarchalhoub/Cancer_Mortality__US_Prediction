<h2 align="center">Empowering Data-Driven Insights in Healthcare</h2>


## Introduction ðŸš€
Welcome to my project dedicated to the prediction of cancer death rates across diverse US counties. I embarked on a data-driven quest to construct a predictive model that empowers resource allocation strategies and contributes to the reduction of cancer-related mortalities.

## Business Understanding ðŸ“Š
Cancer remains a formidable health challenge, especially in the United States. Our objective is to harness the power of predictive analytics to anticipate county-level cancer death rates. This knowledge can be leveraged for the strategic allocation of resources, including research funding, healthcare improvements, and equitable access to life-saving treatments.

## Data Understanding ðŸ“ˆ
The dataset encompasses a comprehensive array of 33 features, spanning demographic and medical statistics. The focal point is the 'TARGET_deathRate,' which represents cancer-related mortalities per 100,000 individuals.

## Data Preparation ðŸ”§
The data underwent meticulous preparation:
- Outliers were addressed.
- Non-numeric data was transformed.
- Missing values were imputed judiciously.
- The dataset was divided into training and development sets.

## Modeling ðŸ¤–
Diverse modeling techniques were applied:
- Part A: Univariate Linear Regression
- Part B: Multivariate Linear Regression
- Part C: Lasso Regression

## Evaluation ðŸ“Š
The results are in, as denoted by Mean Squared Error (MSE) scores:
- Part A1: 616.27
- Part A2: 507.28
- Part B: 306.91
- Part C: 166.06

Part C excels, showcasing its potential to provide precise predictions. The commitment to improvement remains unwavering.

## Deployment ðŸ’¼
The model stands poised for practical implementation:
- Stakeholders, including cancer research organizations, policymakers, and healthcare providers, can employ it to inform decisions and enhance the quality of healthcare.
- This initiative embodies our commitment to saving lives and alleviating the cancer burden.
